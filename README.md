# Canyonero ROS controller

This repo contains a ROS pkg to run the keyboard controller of the Raspberry Pi robot Canyonero. Motion driving can be linked to GPIO library and can be easily set up for keyboard/joystick/autonomous control, by just adjusting commands to the int numbers set on the drivers.

Camera can be accessed from a remote ROS controller.

Details on the implementation, as well as instructions on how to set up the drivers and how to control the robot over ROS are in the main project's [wiki](https://github.com/CVH95/Canyonero/wiki/ROS-Network).
